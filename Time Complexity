ASYMPTOTIC NOTATIONS

1) Θ Notation: The theta notation bounds a functions from above and below, so it defines exact asymptotic behavior.
A simple way to get Theta notation of an expression is to drop low order terms and ignore leading constants. For example, consider the following expression.

3n3 + 6n2 + 6000 = Θ(n3)

Dropping lower order terms is always fine because there will always be a n0 after which Θ(n3) has higher values than Θn2) irrespective of the constants involved.
For a given function g(n), we denote Θ(g(n)) is following set of functions.
Θ(g(n)) = {f(n): there exist positive constants c1, c2 and n0 such 
    that 0 <= c1*g(n) <= f(n) <= c2*g(n) for all n >= n0}

The above definition means, if f(n) is theta of g(n), then the value f(n) is always between c1*g(n) and c2*g(n) for large values of n (n >= n0). The definition of theta also requires that f(n) must be non-negative for values of n greater than n0.


2) Big O Notation: The Big O notation defines an upper bound of an algorithm, it bounds a function only from above. For example, consider the case of Insertion Sort. It takes linear time in best case and quadratic time in worst case. We can safely say that the time complexity of Insertion sort is O(n^2). Note that O(n^2) also covers linear time.
If we use Θ notation to represent time complexity of Insertion sort, we have to use two statements for best and worst cases:
1. The worst case time complexity of Insertion Sort is Θ(n^2).
2. The best case time complexity of Insertion Sort is Θ(n).

The Big O notation is useful when we only have upper bound on time complexity of an algorithm. Many times we easily find an upper bound by simply looking at the algorithm.
O(g(n)) = { f(n): there exist positive constants c and 
    n0 such that 0 <= f(n) <= c*g(n) for all n >= n0}
    
3) Ω Notation: Just as Big O notation provides an asymptotic upper bound on a function, Ω notation provides an asymptotic lower bound.

Ω Notation can be useful when we have lower bound on time complexity of an algorithm. The Omega notation is the least used notation among all three.

For a given function g(n), we denote by Ω(g(n)) the set of functions.
Ω (g(n)) = {f(n): there exist positive constants c and
    n0 such that 0 <= c*g(n) <= f(n) for all n >= n0}.
    
    
    
It is important to analyze an algorithm after writing it to find it's efficiency in terms of time and space in order to improve it if possible.

When it comes to analyzing algorithms, the asymptotic analysis seems to be the best way possible to do so. This is because asymptotic analysis analyzes algorithms in terms of the input size. It checks how are the time and space growing in terms of the input size.

In this post, we will take an example of Linear Search and analyze it using Asymptotic analysis.

We can have three cases to analyze an algorithm:
Worst Case
Average Case
Best Case

Below is the algorithm for performing linear search:
// Linearly search x in arr[]. 
// If x is present then return the index,
// otherwise return -1
search(int arr[], int n, int x)
{
    int i;

    for (i=0; i    {
        if (arr[i] == x)
            return true;
    }

    return false;
}

Worst Case Analysis (Usually Done) In the worst case analysis, we calculate upper bound on running time of an algorithm. We must know the case that causes the maximum number of operations to be executed. For Linear Search, the worst case happens when the element to be searched (x in the above code) is not present in the array. When x is not present, the search() functions compares it with all the elements of arr[] one by one. Therefore, the worst case time complexity of linear search would be O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array.

Average Case Analysis (Sometimes done) In average case analysis, we take all possible inputs and calculate computing time for all of the inputs. Sum all the calculated values and divide the sum by total number of inputs. We must know (or predict) distribution of cases. For the linear search problem, let us assume that all cases are uniformly distributed (including the case of x not being present in array). So we sum all the cases and divide the sum by (N+1). Following is the value of average case time complexity.
Average Case Time = analysis1

Best Case Analysis (Bogus) : In the best case analysis, we calculate lower bound on running time of an algorithm. We must know the case that causes minimum number of operations to be executed. In the linear search problem, the best case occurs when x is present at the first location. The number of operations in the best case is constant (not dependent on N). So time complexity in the best case would be O(1)

Important Points:
Most of the times, we do the worst case analysis to analyze algorithms. In the worst analysis, we guarantee an upper bound on the running time of an algorithm which is a good piece of information.
The average case analysis is not easy to do in most of the practical cases and it is rarely done. In the average case analysis, we must know (or predict) the mathematical distribution of all possible inputs.
The Best Case analysis is bogus. Guaranteeing a lower bound on an algorithm doesn't provide any information as in the worst case, an algorithm may take years to run.
